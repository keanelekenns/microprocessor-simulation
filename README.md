## microprocessor-simulation
This is a simulation of the Intel 8008 microprocessor chip written in C. It was completed as a school project in the spring of 2019 and not all features of the chip were simulated for the sake of time.

## Usage
To use the simulated microprocessor, run ```make``` in the root directory, then run ```./main <filename>```.

Example files can be found in the test_programs directory.
